        <ol type="1">
            <li> <strong>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</strong>
                <br>My name is Abigail, I'm a senior studying Finance in the Olin business school. I also have two minors; one in computer science and one in design.</li>
                <br>
            <li> <strong>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</strong>
                <br>I grew up in the Chicago suburbs (pretty cold up there too). Growing up I always enjoyed art; thus, when I got to business school, I realized something was missing. I declared my design minor as an outlet for my creativity. This class fulfills some credits I need for the minor, and I'm excited to learn more about digital design through this course.</li>
                <br>
            <li> <strong>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</strong>
                <br>I have a little bit of experience with HTML/CSS/JS through one other class I took. However, it has been over 2 years, so I am a bit rusty.</li>
                <br>
            <li> <strong>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</strong>
                <br>I hope to learn tactics to communicate my message through art. I haven't taken an upper level communication design class before, and I think I have a lot to learn!</li>
                <br>
            <li> <strong>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</strong>
                <br>I expect the level of control to be the most difficult thing when designing on the computer rather than paper. On the computer, I'm limited by knowledge of code in order to have full control.</li>
                <br>
            <li> <strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</strong>
                <br>I think the <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple website</a> exemplifies effective design. When you click into a product details, you are immersed in this dynamic, future-esque space with high quality media that reflects the high tech products Apple is releasing.</li>
                <br>
            <li> <strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</strong>
                <br>I think my <a href="https://www.vapld.info/">local library</a> website exemplifies effective communication. Although the design isn't complicated, the text is easy to read for all ages, the website looks clean, the images are useful, and they organize the website information in a way that leads me to keep reading.</li>
                <br>
            <li> <strong>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</strong>
                <br>I think <a href="https://open.spotify.com/?">Spotify's</a> website works really well for both newcomers and experienced Spotify listeners. The website is straightforward and easy to navigate; and if an individual wants to explore they can. There is a plentiful of information present, but it's clean and tucked away for the user to find through interactive elements.</li>
                <br>
