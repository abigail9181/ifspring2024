    <h1>Matcha Tiramisu Recipe</h1>
    <p> This matcha tiramisu has layers of ultra creamy matcha filling and matcha soaked ladyfingers. It’s full of
        matcha flavor! It has that perfectly creamy texture of traditional tiramisu, but doesn’t contain any coffee or
        raw eggs. It’s the perfect make ahead cake if you love matcha, or want a delicious twist on a traditional
        tiramisu. </p>

    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift matcha into a medium bowl to break up any lumps. Add hot water to the matcha and whisk well using a
            matcha whisk or regular wire whisk to combine until smooth. 2 tablespoons matcha powder,¼ cup water </li>
        <img src="photos/1. whisk_matcha_and_water_until_smooth.jpeg" alt="whisk-batcha-and-water-until-smooth">
        <li>Add milk into the dissolved matcha and stir to combine. Set the matcha milk aside in the fridge.
            1 cup milk </li>
        <img src="photos/2.add_milk_to_bowl_with_matcha.jpeg" alt="add-milk-to-bowl-with-matcha">
        <li>Pour a few inches of water into a medium saucepan. Find a heat safe bowl that fits well on top of the pan
            without touching the bottom or the water. Bring the water in the saucepan to a simmer. </li>
        <img src="photos/3.whisk_matcha_filling_together.jpeg" alt="whisk-matcha-filling-together">
        <li>Combine yolks, eggs, sugar, vanilla, and ½ cup of the previously prepared matcha milk mixture in the heat
            safe bowl. Whisk until combined.4 large egg yolks,2 large eggs,⅔ cup granulated sugar,1 teaspoon pure
            vanilla extract </li>
        <img src="photos/4.cooking_filling_on_double_boiler.jpeg" alt="cook-filling-on-boiler">
        <li>Place the bowl on top of the saucepan and whisk. Continue whisking with a wire whisk until the mixture foams
            up and thickens considerably. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. </li>
        <img src="photos/5.cooked_filling_for_matcha_tiramisu.jpeg" alt="cooked-filling-for-matcha-tiramisu">
        <li>While the egg mixture cools, whip the heavy cream until medium-stiff peaks with a whisk or stand mixer. Be
            careful not to overwhip or it will become grainy. Set aside in the fridge.1 ½ cup heavy whipping cream </li>
        <img src="photos/6.whisk_whipping_cream_to_stiff_peaks.jpeg" alt="whisk-until-stiff-peaks">
        <li>In a separate large bowl, add mascarpone cheese and whisk or beat briefly until smooth. Do not overmix or it
            will become liquidy and won’t set. This is just done to remove any lumps. 1 lb mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li> Pour the thickened and cooled matcha filling into the mascarpone cheese and whisk or beat together very
            briefly until combined, being careful not to overmix.</li>
        <img src="photos/7.beat_mascarpone_until_creamy.jpeg" alt="beat-until-creamy">
        <li>Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture with a whisk until even and smooth. </li>
        <img src="photos/8.fold_matcha_tiramisu_filling.jpeg" alt="fold-filling">
    </ol>

    <h3>Assembly:</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>One by one, briefly dip
            a ladyfinger in the reserved matcha milk mixture and place a single layer inside a
            casserole dish. 2 packages ladyfingers </li>
        <img src="photos/A1.dip_ladyfingers_in_matcha_tea.jpeg" alt="dip-ladyfingers-in-tea">
        <li>Spread half of the
            filling over the ladyfingers, smoothing the filling all the way to the edges. Dip more
            ladyfingers in the tea, arranging them on top of the filling in a single layer. Add the rest of the filling
            and smooth the top.
            If you're running out of the matcha milk tea, add milk to stretch it. If you have any leftover, pour it into
            a glass, add ice and extra milk, and enjoy your iced matcha tea latte. </li>
        <img src="photos/A2.layering_more_matcha_dipped_ladyfingers.jpeg" alt="layer-and-repeat">
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for at
            least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <img src="photos/A3.smooth_matcha_tiramisu_filling.jpeg" alt="smooth-filling">
        <li>The day of
            serving, decorate by sifting some more matcha on top.
            Optionally: To create a flower design, place cut out parchment paper flowers on top of the tiramisu before
            dusting with matcha powder. Carefully remove the parchment paper flowers and pipe small dollops of yellow
            whipped cream or frosting into the middle of each flower for the flower centers.
            2 teaspoons matcha powder</li>
        <img src="photos/A4.making_matcha_flowers_on_matcha_tiramisu.jpeg" alt="make-matcha-flowers">
        <li>Scoop or slice and serve!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Additional Notes:</h3>

    <p>This matcha tiramisu will keep well in the fridge for up to four days. Freeze, wrapped tightly, for up to two
        months. It keeps really well in the freezer and tastes like ice cream when frozen.</p>
    <p>Ladyfingers: Depending on the dimensions of your baking dish, you may need more or less ladyfingers. I used two 5
        oz packages of Milano giant ladyfingers. You can use your favorite vanilla cookies or sandwich cookies instead.
    </p>
    <p> Matcha: Preferably use ceremonial grade matcha for a less bitter flavor and brighter color. Culinary will also
        work, but it is more bitter and dull in color.</p>

    <h3>Helpful Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use non-metal dishes for making matcha dessert. Metal gives matcha a metallic aftertaste. </li>
        <li>Don't overwhip the mascarpone. It needs an initial mix to smooth out any lumps but after that, mix gently.
            If mascarpone is overmixed it will become liquidy and won't set. </li>
        <li>Whip the cream to stiff peaks and fold it into the filling very gently. This helps thicken the filling and
            sets the tiramisu. It adds a lot of air into the tiramisu giving it a mousse-like texture. This tiramisu
            uses whipped cream instead of raw whipped egg whites like traditional tiramisu does.</li>
        <li>Chill the tiramisu for 8 hours or overnight to set. This allows enough time for the ladyfingers to soak
            through and soften up, and for the filling to set.</li>
    </ul>
