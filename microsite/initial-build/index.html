            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson was a criminal trial in Los Angeles
                County Superior Court starting in 1994, in which O. J. Simpson, a former National Football League (NFL)
                player, broadcaster and actor, was tried and acquitted for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown
                Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. The pair were stabbed to death outside Brown's condominium in the
                Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles on the night of June 12, 1994. The trial spanned eleven months,
                from November 9, 1994,[1] to October 3, 1995.</p>

            <p> Opening statements were made on January 24, 1995.[2] Though prosecutors argued that Simpson was
                implicated by a significant amount of forensic evidence, Simpson was ultimately acquitted of both counts
                of murder on October 3 of the same year.[3][4][5] Commentators agree that the defense capitalized on
                anger among the city's African-American community toward the LAPD, which had a history of racial bias,
                to convince the majority-Black jury to acquit Simpson.[6][7][8] The trial is often characterized as the
                trial of the century because of its international publicity. It has been described as the "most
                publicized" criminal trial in human history.[9]The People of the State of California v. Orenthal James
                Simpson was a criminal trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court starting in 1994, in which O. J.
                Simpson, a former National Football League (NFL) player, broadcaster and actor, was tried and acquitted

            <p>Opening statements were made on January 24, 1995.[2] Though prosecutors argued that Simpson was
                implicated by a significant amount of forensic evidence, Simpson was ultimately acquitted of both counts

                to convince the majority-Black jury to acquit Simpson.[6][7][8] The trial is often characterized as the
                trial of the century because of its international publicity. It has been described as the "most
                publicized" criminal trial in human history.[9] </p>

            <p>Following questioning by police detectives, Simpson was formally charged with the murders on June 17
                after investigators found a blood-stained glove on his property. When he did not turn himself in at the
                agreed time, he became the subject of a low-speed police pursuit while riding in a white 1993 Ford
                Bronco SUV owned and driven by his friend Al Cowlings.[10] TV stations interrupted coverage of the 1994
                NBA Finals to broadcast live coverage of the pursuit, which was watched by an estimated 95 million
                people.[11] The pursuit and Simpson's arrest later on the same day were among the most widely publicized
                events in American history.</p>

            <p>Simpson was represented by a high-profile defense team, referred to as the "Dream Team", which was
                initially led by Robert Shapiro[12][13] and subsequently directed by Johnnie Cochran. The team also
                included F. Lee Bailey, Alan Dershowitz, Robert Kardashian, Shawn Holley, Carl E. Douglas, and Gerald
                Uelmen. Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld were two additional attorneys who specialized in DNA evidence.
            </p>

            <p>While Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark, William Hodgman, and Christopher Darden believed they had a
                strong case against Simpson, Cochran and the defense team persuaded the jury that there was reasonable
                doubt concerning the DNA evidence in this case.[3] They contended that the blood sample had been
                mishandled by lab scientists and technicians[14] and that the case against Simpson had been tainted by
                LAPD misconduct related to racism and incompetence, in particular noting actions and comments of
                Detective Mark Fuhrman. Using DNA evidence in trials was still new, and many people did not understand
                how to evaluate it.</p>

            <p>The trial was considered historically significant for the wide division in reaction to the verdict by the
                public.[15] Observers' opinions of the verdict were largely related to their ethnicity; the media dubbed
                this the "racial gap".[16] A poll of Los Angeles County residents showed that most African Americans
                thought that the "not guilty" verdict was justified, while the majority of whites thought it was a
                racially motivated jury nullification[17][18] by the mostly African-American jury.[19] More recent
                polling shows this "gap" has narrowed since the trial. In 2013, more than half of polled black
                respondents said that they believed Simpson was guilty.[20] In 2017 on an episode of The Jury Speaks,
                three of the jurors who acquitted Simpson said that in retrospect they would still vote to acquit. One
                said he would vote to convict.[21]</p>

            <p>Nicole Brown met O.J. Simpson in 1977[23] when he was 30 and she was 18 and working as a waitress at the
                Daisy (a Beverly Hills private club).[24][25] They began dating although Simpson was married. Simpson
                filed for divorce from his first wife in March 1979.</p>

            <p>He and Brown married on February 2, 1985.[26][27][28] Brown and Simpson had two children together,
                daughter Sydney (b. 1985) and son Justin (b. 1988).[29] According to Lenore Walker, the Simpson–Brown
                marriage was a "textbook example of domestic abuse".[30][31][32] Brown signed a prenuptial agreement and
                was prohibited from working while married.[33]</p>

            <p>Brown wrote that she felt conflicted about notifying police of the abuse because she was financially
                dependent on Simpson.[30] Brown described an incident in which Simpson broke her arm during a fight; in
                order to prevent him from being arrested, she had told emergency room staff that she had fallen off her
                bike.[34] She wrote about him beating her in public, during sex, and even in front of family and
                friends.[35] Of the 62 incidents of abuse, the police were notified eight times, and Simpson was
                arrested once.[36][37][38] On February 25, 1992, Brown filed for divorce, citing "irreconcilable
                differences".[39]</p>

            <p>Brown said that Simpson stalked and harassed her after they divorced – an intimidation tactic meant to
                force the victim to return to the abuser.[40][41] She documented an incident in which he spied on her
                having sex with her new boyfriend.[42] Afterwards, Brown said she felt her life was in danger because
                Simpson had threatened to kill her if he ever found her with another man.[43] She drafted a will.[44]
                Brown telephoned Sojourn, a women's shelter, on June 8, 1994.[45][46] She was considering staying at the
                shelter because she was afraid of what Simpson might do to her, as she was refusing his pleas to
                reconcile their marriage.[47] She had reported a set of keys missing from her house a few weeks earlier.
                The keys were later found on Simpson when he was arrested for the murders of Brown and Ron Goldman.[48]

            <h3>Trial</h3>

            <p>Simpson wanted a speedy trial, and the defense and prosecuting attorneys worked around the clock for
                several months to prepare their cases. The trial began on January 24, 1995, seven months after the
                murders, and was televised by closed-circuit TV camera via Court TV, and in part by other cable and
                network news outlets, for 134 days. Judge Lance Ito presided over the trial in the C.S. Foltz Criminal
                Courts Building.</p>

            <strong> The Jury</strong>

            <p>District Attorney Gil Garcetti elected to file charges in downtown Los Angeles, as opposed to Santa
                Monica, in which jurisdiction the crimes took place.[139] The Los Angeles Superior Court then decided to
                hold the trial in Downtown Los Angeles instead of Santa Monica due to safety issues at the Santa Monica
                Court house owing to the 1994 Northridge earthquake.[140] The decision may have affected the trial's
                outcome because it resulted in a jury pool that was less educated, had lower incomes, and contained more
                African Americans.[141] Richard Gabriel, a jury consultant for Simpson, wrote that more educated jurors
                with higher incomes were more likely to accept the validity of DNA evidence and the argument that
                domestic violence is a prelude to murder. Gabriel noted that African Americans were far more likely than
                other minorities to be receptive to claims of racially motivated fraud by the police.[139]
            <p>

            <p>
                In October 1994, Judge Lance Ito started interviewing 304 prospective jurors, each of whom had to fill
                out a 75-page questionnaire. On November 3, twelve jurors were seated with twelve alternates. Over the
                course of the trial, ten were dismissed for a wide variety of reasons. Only four of the original jurors
                remained on the final panel.[142]</p>

            <p> According to media reports, Clark believed women, regardless of race, would sympathize with the domestic
                violence aspect of the case and connect with Brown personally. On the other hand, the defense's research
                suggested that black women would not be sympathetic to Brown, who was white, because of tensions about
                interracial marriages. Both sides accepted a disproportionate number of female jurors. From an original
                jury pool of 40 percent white, 28 percent black, 17 percent Hispanic, and 15 percent Asian, the final
                jury for the trial had ten women and two men, of whom nine were black, two white, and one
                Hispanic.[143][144][clarification needed]</p>

            <p>On April 5, 1995, juror Jeanette Harris was dismissed when Judge Ito learned she had failed to disclose
                an incident of domestic abuse.[145] Afterwards, Harris gave an interview and accused the deputies of
                racism and claimed the jurors were dividing themselves along racial lines. Ito then met with the jurors,
                who all denied Harris's allegations of racial tension among themselves. The following day, Ito dismissed
                the three deputies anyway, which upset the jurors that did not complain because the dismissal appeared
                to lend credence to Harris's allegations, which they all denied.[146] On April 21, thirteen of the
                eighteen jurors refused to come to court until they spoke with Ito about it. Ito then ordered them to
                court and the 13 protesters responded by wearing all black and refusing to come out to the jury box upon
                arrival.[147] The media described this incident as a "Jury Revolt" and the protesters wearing all black
                as resembling a "funeral procession".[148][149][150][151]</p>

            <div id="two-sides">
                <div id="prosecution">
                    <strong> Prosecution</strong>
                    <p>The two lead prosecutors were Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark and William Hodgman, who was
                        replaced as lead prosecutor by Christopher Darden. Clark was designated as the lead prosecutor
                        and Darden became Clark's co-counsel. Prosecutors Hank Goldberg and Hodgman, who had
                        successfully prosecuted high-profile cases in the past, assisted Clark and Darden. Two
                        prosecutors who were DNA experts, Rockne Harmon and George "Woody" Clarke, were brought in to
                        present the DNA evidence in the case and were assisted by Prosecutor Lisa Kahn.[152][153][154]
                    </p>

                    <h4>Theory</h4>
                    <p>The prosecution argued that the domestic violence within the Simpson-Brown marriage culminated in
                        her murder.[155] Simpson's history of abusing Brown resulted in their divorce and his pleading
                        guilty to one count of domestic violence in 1989.[156] On the night of the murders, Simpson
                        attended a dance recital for his daughter and was reportedly angry with Brown because of a black
                        dress that she wore, which he said was "tight". Simpson's then girlfriend, Paula Barbieri,
                        wanted to attend the recital with Simpson but he did not invite her. After the recital, Simpson
                        returned home to a voicemail from Barbieri ending their relationship.</p>

                    <p>According to the prosecution, Simpson then drove over to Brown's home in his Ford Bronco to
                        reconcile their relationship as a result and when Brown refused, Simpson killed her in a "final
                        act of control". Goldman then came upon the scene to return some eyeglasses and was murdered as
                        well in order to silence him and remove any witnesses. Afterwards, the prosecution said that
                        Simpson walked to his Bronco and drove home, where he parked it and walked into his house.
                        There, he took off his blood stained clothes, put them in the knapsack (except his socks and the
                        glove), put clean ones on, and left towards the limousine. At the Airport, prosecution said that
                        Simpson opened the knapsack, removed the clothes, Bruno Magli shoes, and the murder weapon, and
                        threw them in the trash before putting the knapsack in one of his suitcases and headed towards
                        his flight.[157][158][159]</p>

                    <h4>Timeline</h4>

                    <p>Los Angeles County Chief Medical Examiner Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran testified on June 14, 1995,
                        that Brown's time of death was estimated as between 10:00 pm and 10:30 pm.[183][184] Kato Kaelin
                        testified on March 22, 1995, that he last saw Simpson at 9:36 pm that evening. Simpson was not
                        seen again until 10:54 pm when he answered the intercom at the front door for the limousine
                        driver, Allan Park.[185][186] Simpson had no alibi for approximately one hour and 18 minutes
                        during which time the murders took place.[187] Allan Park testified on March 28 that he arrived
                        at Simpson's home at 10:25 pm on the night of the murders and stopped at the Rockingham
                        entrance: Simpson's Bronco was not there.[188] He then drove over to the Ashford entrance and
                        rang the intercom three times, getting no answer, starting at 10:40pm.[189]</p>

                    <p>Park's testimony was significant because it explained the location of the glove found at
                        Simpson's home.[190] The blood trail from the Bronco to the front door was easily understood but
                        the glove was found on the other side of the house. Park said the "shadowy figure" initially
                        approached the front door before heading down the southern walkway which leads to where the
                        glove was found by Fuhrman. The prosecution believed that Simpson had driven his Bronco to and
                        from Brown's home to commit the murders, saw that Park was there and aborted his attempt to
                        enter through the front door and tried to enter through the back instead.[191] He panicked and
                        made the sounds that Kaelin heard when he realized that the security system would not let him
                        enter through the rear entrance.[192] He then discarded the glove, came back and went through
                        the front door.[14] During cross examination, Park conceded that he could not identify the
                        figure but said he saw that person enter the front door and afterwards Simpson answered and said
                        he was home alone. Park conceded that he did not notice any cuts on Simpson's left hand but

                    <strong>Defense</strong>

                    <p>Simpson hired a team of high-profile defense lawyers, initially led by Robert Shapiro, who was
                        previously a civil lawyer known for settling, and then subsequently by Johnnie Cochran, who at
                        that point was known for police brutality and civil rights cases.[228] The team included noted
                        defense attorney F. Lee Bailey, Robert Kardashian, Harvard appeals lawyer Alan Dershowitz, his
                        student Robert Blasier, and Dean of Santa Clara University School of Law Gerald Uelmen.
                        Assisting Cochran were Carl E. Douglas and Shawn Holley. Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld were
                        also hired; they headed the Innocence Project and specialized in DNA evidence. Simpson's defense
                        was said to have cost between US$3 million and $6 million; the media dubbed the group of
                        talented attorneys the Dream Team,[229][230] while the taxpayer cost of prosecution was over
                        US$9 million.[231]</p>

                    <h4>Theory</h4>

                    <p>The defense team's reasonable doubt theory was summarized as "compromised, contaminated,
                        corrupted" in opening statements.[232][160] They argued that the DNA evidence against Simpson
                        was "compromised" by the mishandling of criminalists Dennis Fung and Andrea Mazzola during the
                        collection phase of evidence gathering, and that 100 percent of the "real killer(s)" DNA had
                        vanished from the evidence samples.[233] The evidence was then "contaminated" in the LAPD crime
                        lab by criminalist Collin Yamauchi, and Simpson's DNA from his reference vial was transferred to
                        all but three exhibits.[234] The remaining three exhibits were planted by the police and thus
                        "corrupted" by police fraud.[235] The defense also questioned the timeline, claiming the murders
                        happened around 11:00 pm that night.[236]</p>

                    <h4>Timeline</h4>
                    <p>The physician Robert Huizenga testified on July 14, 1995[237] that Simpson was not physically
                        capable of carrying out the murders due to chronic arthritis and old football injuries. During
                        cross-examination, the prosecution produced an exercise video that Simpson made a few weeks
                        before the murders titled O.J. Simpson Minimum Maintenance: Fitness for Men, which demonstrated
                        that Simpson was anything but frail.[238] Huizenga admitted afterwards that Simpson could have
                        committed the murders if he was in "the throes of an adrenaline-rush".[239]</p>

                    <p>Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist, testified that the murders[240] happened closer to
                        11:00pm, which is when Simpson has an alibi[241][242] and stated that Brown was still conscious,
                        standing, and took a step after her throat was cut[243] and that Goldman was standing and
                        fighting his assailant for ten minutes with a lacerated jugular vein.[244][245]</p>

                    <p>After the trial, Baden admitted his claim of Goldman's long struggle was inaccurate[246][247] and
                        that testifying for Simpson was a mistake.[248] Critics claimed that Baden knowingly gave false
                        testimony in order to collect a $100,000 retainer[249][250][251] because the week before he
                        testified, John Gerdes admitted[252] that Goldman's blood was in Simpson's Bronco[253] despite
                        Goldman never having an opportunity within his lifetime to be in the Bronco.[254]</p>

            <strong>The Verdict</strong>

            <p>Fears grew that race riots, similar to the riots in 1992, would erupt across Los Angeles and the rest of
                the country if Simpson were convicted of the murders. As a result, all Los Angeles police officers were
                put on 12-hour shifts. The police arranged for more than 100 police officers on horseback to surround
                the Los Angeles County courthouse on the day the verdict was announced, in case of rioting by the crowd.
                President Bill Clinton was briefed on security measures if rioting were to occur nationwide.</p>

            <p>The only testimony that the jury reviewed was that of limo driver Park.[72] At 10:07 am on Tuesday,
                October 3, 1995, Simpson was acquitted on both counts of murder. The jury arrived at the verdict by 3:00
                pm on October 2, after four hours of deliberation, but it postponed the announcement.[130] After the
                verdict was read, juror number nine, 44-year-old Lionel Cryer, gave Simpson a black power raised fist
                salute.[340] The New York Times reported that Cryer was a former member of the revolutionary nationalist
                Black Panther Party that prosecutors had "inexplicably left on the panel".[341]</p>

            <p>An estimated 100 million people worldwide watched or listened to the verdict's announcement.
                Long-distance telephone call volume declined by 58 percent, and trading volume on the New York Stock
                Exchange decreased by 41 percent. Water usage decreased as people avoided using bathrooms. So much work
                stopped that the verdict cost an estimated $480 million in lost productivity.[130][better source needed]
                The US Supreme Court received a message on the verdict during oral arguments, with the justices quietly
                passing the note to each other while listening to the attorney's presentation. Congressmen canceled
                press conferences, with Joe Lieberman telling reporters, "Not only would you not be here, but I wouldn't
                be here, either".[342]</p>
